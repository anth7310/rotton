STAR_1,"Disney had a pretty easy job when it bought Lucas Films.  All they had to do was to tell a decent original story in the Star Wars world set up by Lucas.  But rather then using the same world and changing the story, Disney chose to tell the same story and change the world.  The result is both predictable and incoherent.  It's predictable in the sense that the viewer is left feeling as though he or she is watching the same story that Lucas told 40 years ago.  And it's incoherent in the sense that the new elements of the story don't fit within the world of Star Wars.  Disney makes no attempt to explain how these new elements fit or even to make the new trilogy's world internally consistent.

STAR_2_5,"Full disclosure this review is through the lens of a Star Wars fan, please be aware that there are spoilers ahead!

1. Overwhelming Pace - I thought the scene lengths were too short and changed too frequently especially at the start of the movie. There was a lot of ground to cover in attempting to tie together an entire 9 movie saga which was the reason for some of this however it was still too much.

2. Not the Best Writing - This is a criticism of the latest trilogy but it was evident in the final movie, it didn't seem like Kathleen Kennedy or Disney had an overall clean and concise vision for the story arch of this saga. It was reported that Disney gave full creative control to each movies director, on the surface this sounds like a good thing but I believe it caused most of their headaches when writing The Rise of Skywalker. If they had followed the Marvel Universe model of having an executive producer (Kevin Feige) involved throughout the writing process I think they would have had more success. 

3. Rushed - I'm sure having Emperor Palpatine reprise his role in The Rise of Skywalker wasn't part of the plan from the beginning but was a result of Rian Johnson killing off Snoke in the previous chapter. Although I liked seeing Palpatine because he was a great character I thought the way he was used in this zombie like form was a bit weird, using him as a Sith version of the force ghost would have been better. Especially because with him being ""alive"" somewhat undoes the nice arch on Vaders story of bringing balance to the force. 

There were other elements like the searching for Sith and Jedi artifacts which I liked but felt rushed, we didn't really know anything about these or the importance of them prior to the final movie. 

It does attempt to write many perceived ""wrongs"" from The Last Jedi and I did appreciate the attempt to please fans, however there were problems from the previous two movies that couldn't be undone for the final chapter.",Jawad M,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/528510306/picture,False,False,False,False,2019-12-31T19:35:31.853Z,2019-12-31T19:35:36.360Z,"{'userId': '938186515', 'realm': 'RT', 'displayName': 'Jawad M', 'accountLink': '/user/id/938186515'}",2.5,2h ago

STAR_3_5,"3.5 Star Review: (Disclaimer: Only read if you have seen the film. No Spoilers here. But I do go into almost spoilerish territory which some may be able to decipher and thus be spoiled by it. To keep those safe, only people who have seen the film should continue)
42 years after the release of one of the biggest theatrical releases of all time, 9 films later and with fandom divided by who knows how many factions now, the ""Skywalker"" saga finally comes to an end. There is a reason why I put the name in quotation marks, but I can't go into that detail or I will be spoiling.
As the final entry in this epic saga, this is a film I care very much about since it was one of my first sci-fi films I ever saw. When I was a kid the only movies I loved watching over and over and over again were the original trilogy movies. Then of course, in 1999, Episode 1 was released and my love for the series continued to grow as I was only 8 years old at the time. I've gone on to read countless novels on the Star Wars universe and have fallen in love with the film making process of bringing the first 6 films to life thanks to the extensive documentaries and special features I've seen on the DVD's and Blu-rays released over the years. My respect for George Lucas and his vision has only grown over the years and while I've grown in disappointment at the fans who vilify him. Thanks to his story that spans 6 films, we have a universe of lore and storytelling that is ripe for new stories to tell and to one day hand over to our kids and future generations. One of the aspects of the 6 films I have tremendous respect for is the art of storytelling that encompasses those films. Through those six films we are shown a narrative that revolves around the Skywalkers and more specifically, the rise and fall and then eventual redemption of Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One. Episode VI - The Return of the Jedi successfully completes the tale and brings the story full circle with Anakin finally coming back to the light and fulfilling the prophecy by killing off Emperor Palpatine. The Rebel Alliance celebrates and there is peace and justice in the galaxy with the force ghosts of Anakin, Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi looking on at Luke, Leia, Han and the rebels as they dance the night away. It was an ending that closed things nicely and as stories and narratives are concerned, it tied up all loose ends and firmly established itself as a Skywalker story from beginning to end.
With the newly released Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker, however, without spoiling anything specific from the film, I see the new storytellers in these films do their best to include call backs across all movies and to be honest, I loved every one of those callbacks. It was nostalgic. Heck, it was MAGICAL at times. Moments that gave me goosebumps watching on the big screen combined with the artistry of John William's fantastic score. But where I am unable to forgive the storytelling of JJ Abrams and Chris Terrio (writer of Argo, Batman v Superman and Justice League) is where they fail to connect Episode 9 to that Anakin/Luke Skywalker story told in the first 6 episodes. Episode IX is easily a 4 star film but the more I've thought about this creative decision (or lack thereof) the more I realize this film and new trilogy ultimately ignores what the first 6 movies were all about and essentially rewrites the story to have Episode IX wind up in the same position as did Episode VI. As a standalone trilogy and focusing solely on Episode IX, I absolutely love Rey and Kylo Ren's story arcs. They are among the most powerful character stories you will find in the Star Wars universe and their stories were done justice. I think everyone can agree that Rey has definitely earned becoming that hero in this new trilogy and it is well deserved. Unfortunately, it comes at the expense of making The Return of the Jedi, and thus the original/prequel trilogy, meaningless. The writers of Episode IX cleverly filled this film with countless homages and callbacks to the original trilogy and some aspects of the prequels as well and in doing so, were able to hide and ultimately forget about the major theme and story of Episodes I-VI. The ending of Episode IX makes me wonder why these 3 new movies are called a part of the Skywalker saga. Sure, there is the symbolic aspect of it, in particular with those last few words spoken in the film. But in all fairness, it was more of a cop-out done by the writers to force this film and this new trilogy to ""fit in"" to the Skywalker saga after not being able to creatively make it happen in a way that took into account the Anakin/Luke story.....which was a true Skywalker story. The film closes the book on this saga but again, that was also already done in Episode VI....with even the final conflict and ultimate resolution resembling some aspects of Return of the Jedi as well.
As mentioned earlier, Episode IX delivers in many other good ways. The homages and call-backs are all fantastic and I found the General Leia scenes to actually fit in quite well to the film as a whole. The film's climax in particular was AMAZING. I will likely see this film again 2 more times just for the climactic battle at the end between........well I can't say who on here or it will spoil the scene. But it's a scene that is beautifully shot and full of the types of symbolism that makes Star Wars so powerful. Oh, and THAT lightsaber you see at a point in the movie where I can't say where or it's a spoiler??? THAT was incredible. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are the clear standouts in this final film, as they should be. Both their characters and their story arcs are wonderfully played out, even if I don't agree on a certain creative decision at the end.
The Rise of Skywalker is a highly entertaining film and is actually quite good on its own. It is definitely a must watch on the biggest screen possible. Personally, I'd recommend seeing it in true IMAX at the TCL Chinese Theatre, AMC IMAX Universal Studios Hollywood or at the Irvine IMAX Spectrum Theatre. All other ""IMAX"" theatres in Southern California are not true IMAX theatres and that includes San Diego. As stated, however, I can't forgive the writers nor the filmmakers for ignoring what the first 6 films were about and what the ending in Episode VI meant. That ending, and thus the conflicts, sacrifices done in those films, have now been rendered meaningless by this new trilogy. Plus, if you really boil it down, we're right back where we were again after Episode VI just now with different characters and a twist.",Adrian D,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/1530878404/picture,False,False,False,False,2019-12-31T16:31:24.657Z,2019-12-31T16:31:28.170Z,"{'userId': '905421310', 'realm': 'RT', 'displayName': 'Adrian D', 'accountLink': '/user/id/905421310'}",3.5,5h ago

STAR_1,"This movie makes no sense. The force awakens was nostalgic yes but set up a new trilogy with new characters. The last jedi dared to do something different and go in a different direction and take star wars somewhere new. This film undermines all of that. Rather than give the film a proper review, here are the questions I'm left with...

How did palpatine return?
Where did he get all those ships, and who is manning them?
Why, in 8 previous films did everyone fail to mention he had a wife or kids? You'd think that would be important.
Why did kylo and ren kiss?
If Palpatine's plan was to get to Rey all along why did he bother with Kylo? 
When could jedi start force healing?
Why had they built up the character of Rose in the last film to give her two minutes of screen time in this one?
Why did they introduce 3 new characters in the final film of the saga? One who literally doesn't even take her helmet off?
Why did they make such a big deal of C3po losing his memory to instantly get it back?
Why did they make a big point of Chewie dying to reveal instantly he hadn't?
Why was General Hux a mole?
Why was the entire plot like the side quest of a video game?
How come after getting chased by storm troopers the landed exactly on the planet where the dagger was they were looking for?
How did they know EXACTLY where to stand with the dagger?
How did Maz get Lukes saber?

STAR_1_5,"I grew up on the first Star Wars, which I'd say have earned an important place in film/art history, not to mention how it has affected culture, myself included. Having said that, this was my least favorite of all the Star Wars movies. The visuals and effects are always nice, but it rushes through the story irresponsibly and dismisses a lot of things that were built in the previous movies (even its own trilogy). Without wanting to give too much away, things all just seem to trivial, from hyperspace skipping, to overpowered force users, and obviously the First Order (what was the point of defeating the empire if it's only going to come back). There is too much emphasis on that, and not enough on the story or character development.
Aside from Star Wars, I like Abrams as a director, and I understand he had some big shoes to fill, but I think he should have allowed himself a little more freedom to tell a more original story. There's just too much concern with the franchise, and not enough with the plot.
Rogue One is an example of a great Star Wars film. It told an original story contained in the star wars universe that wasn't focused on the skywalkers (I mean, come on, in a universe that big there's only one family worthy of telling a story about?) or Jedis, and it was still great in its own way.
I understand Star Wars itself is sort of fantastic, but this is too much. Space fighters shouldn't emit smoke from thrusters, you can't take on a giant star destroyer on horses, and again, you can't just pull yourself out of a pickle by going into hyperspace (and if you can, why didn't we see this in the previous movies?).

STAR_1_5,Star Wars: Rise of the Skywalker was a complete mess of a script and plot.  I had concerns as soon as the film completed the segment of scrolling text in the classic star wars fashion.  Sadly nothing else about the film would fullfil the expectations I have for the Star Wars franchise.  Although I haven't been a huge fan of the latest three in the series it's only been down hill since the first film.  The trend does not change with Rise of the Skywalker.  Rogue One and Solo better captured the spirit and style of the Star Wars franchise despite not being part of the core series.  Only Star Wars movie where I walked out to use the restroom half way through and knew I wasn't missing anything.  Also found myself wondering when it would be over so I could watch the latest episode of the Mandalorian.  If you're like me you'll probably watch this movie anyways but that doesn't mean Disney deserves being rewarded for selling us a pile of nostalgic trash.,Samuel D,https://graph.facebook.com/v3.3/19719573/picture,False,False,False,False,2019-12-30T20:53:26.823Z,2019-12-30T20:53:35.125Z,"{'userId': '932902109', 'realm': 'RT', 'displayName': 'Samuel D', 'accountLink': '/user/id/932902109'}",1.5,1d ago
STAR_2_5,At first I was going to give this movie a 3 out 5 stars but then I was like nah its not that good. Now I think Rise of Skywalker is better then all the critics are saying about it. I like it more then The Last Jedi (Which I gave 1 out 5 stars). This movie brings answers to the questions from the previous 2 movies but it gives you more answers that was never answered in this movie. I think this whole trilogy did not need to be made. Just give us a Old Republic Trilogy already. Like no one gives a crap about the characters in this new sequel trilogy. I find Rey being the emperors granddaughter is so dumb too. She should have been a skywalker. How Kylo Ren went out was dumb also. Now I might be saying all these bad things about this movie. However I enjoyed the movie for what it is a great entertainment for My friend and I. Some choices in the movie also didn't make any sense whatsoever.

Unfortunately this film is far from able to claim the high ground over TLJ in terms of story quality or respect for the established Star Wars lore, which was unfathomable to me before seeing TROS. Plain to see that this was the result of Lucasfilm having no coherent vision for the overarching story from the very beginning of the sequel trilogy. This ending cements my feeling that none of the sequel films belong as a continuation of episodes 1-6. These new films are just stapled on to the end of ROTJ for the cash grab; there was no apparent sense of obligation on the part of Lucasfilm to provide Star Wars fans with so much as a competent story, let alone an interesting one. Way to bungle the incredible potential of this universe. Not only did you screw up your own stories at nearly every turn, you attempted to retroactively undo all the achievements of our beloved heroes in the OT... especially with the revival of Palpatine in this film, which was just bafflingly stupid.

STAR_3_5,"(Minor spoilers ahead!) 
This was overall a solid Star Wars movie; I'd say it's the best in the sequel trilogy. Better than The Last Jedi, and slightly more exciting than The Force Awakens. However, there are some things I'm not sure about.
-The movie was REALLY fast paced, and we barely got a chance to process what was happening. 
-There was one time where we were told that a certain character is dead, but is revealed to be OK 5 minutes later, so it kinda got us upset for nothing.
-The main antagonist, one who is EXTREMELY powerful with the Force, died far too easily in my opinion. 
-The ending was a bit disappointing, and I left the theater with a lot of questions about it.

Abrams tries to pack so much action into the movie that you dont realize that the story is poorly written and riddled with plot holes. The characters are the same bland, vacuous personalities that no one cares about, although there is some attempt at something resembling character development. One of the worst things that this film and trilogy does is ignore the rules and parameters of the universe in which they are operating. Making up or changing rules from previously established material is the ultimate characteristic of bad storytelling, showing either a laziness to review the source material or a blatant disregard for the source material. Disney seems to think that they can just keep pumping out crappy films and slapping the Star Wars name on them while putting in minimal effort so that they can make as much money as possible. I, for one, disregard completely 7, 8, & 9. Theyre not Star Wars films theyre an easy cash grab for a corporation that has zero creativity or respect for the Star Wars universe.

Once again, the director had to rebuild the confidence of an extremely demanding audience certainly, but above all, emotionally involved in this series for so long.
The paste of the film is fast, very fast, and while some creative decisions left me perplexed, this was a really fun ride and a satisfying conclusion to the saga.
